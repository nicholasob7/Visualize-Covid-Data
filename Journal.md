# Project Visualize Covid Data – Nick Chitsamrerng

## Weekly Journal – Week 1

I have been working with Nicholas and Sameera on creating a statistical website with react. The first week was dedicated to project planning and researching desirable libraries for the project. The team focused on designing the wireframe using the Miro board and investigating data sources for API, the programming language we will be using. To keep everyone on the same page, the project supervisor (Nick Do) outlines what we are aiming to achieve as well as how the website should function. 

### Challenges 
In its initial state, the project faces the challenge of gathering the right API sources and selecting the right frontend libraries. Because we are unfamiliar with the programming language, it is difficult to estimate the time frame. Our instructor Nick Do helped us to manage and prioritize the tasks throughout these processes.

## Weekly Journal – Week 2

Which goal or Milestone you were working towards
Having searched for many different charting libraries, I finally decided on react-chartjs-2 because it supports a variety of chart types, including bars, lines, and pies, which perfectly fits the needs of virtualization. Nicholas had recommended very good react tutorials to me and I started watching them and learning about chart.js. Up until that point, my teammates and I had very little experience with react.

### Challenges 
I've experimented with editing the charts, changing the legend labels, and adding various datasets. I'm still having trouble plotting line charts and data in time series, even after following several tutorials.

### Retrospective
Overall, the project progressed smoothly with all group members taking an active part in project work. The stand-up meetings, held five days a week, were well attended and each group member was able to articulate their work. Given the project parameters, each person was also able to work on elements that interested them.

## Weekly Journal – Week 3
Which goal or Milestone you were working towards
The team is developing a responsive line chart that visualizes global cases, deaths, and recoveries. I am working on a simple bar chart and a map to visualize COVID 19 this week. I used Charts.js to draw the chart.

### Challenges
Due to the complexity of transforming data into plottable form, line chart plotting was more difficult than I expected. Lack of clear documentation also made creating a chart and map harder for beginners. With the help of Nick Do, a chart displaying covid 19 was successfully created. Nick demonstrated the use of line charts from API data, and I followed along by creating a bar chart to display covid-19 testing in different continents.


## Weekly Journal – Week 4
In order to complete the world map, I decided to use Leaflet, a JavaScript interactive mapping library that has excellent documentation and doesn't require tokens, with only a few lines of code, the Leaflet map can be displayed on a screen. We only need to initialize the Map component with the latitude/longitude and zoom-level and latitude/longitude.

### Challenges
Many tutorials for creating maps were available, but they were produced in 2020 or 2021, and some libraries are already outdated. I was unable to display the map after following the tutorials. Data input for the map can be a tricky part of visualization, since the map pulls data owned and updated by another organization (Johns Hopkins). 

### Reflection
The group worked well together and was able to produce a vitalization output.  I learned how to do my research and challenge myself by delivering the vitalization based on the requirements. Though the visualization is simple, it helps me understand how the codes are connected. The group was also lucky that the project supervisors had significant experience in react and a vision around how to use new tools, including React Chart JS, to ensure that the coding went smoothly.
