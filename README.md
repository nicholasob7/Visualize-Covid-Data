# Day 2-29/06/2022

**Wednesday**

**Meeting 3**

* Held discord meeting at 10.00 am with Nick Chitsamrerng, Sameera Begum, and Nicholas O'Brien.

**Meeting 4**

* Held zoom meeting at 10.30 am with Nick Do, Nick Chitsamrerng, Sameera Begum, Nicholas O'Brien.
* Shared disease.sh site and its major data source website with Nick Do.
* Sameera expressed concern that the disease.sh was already a finished product and might not fulfill our project goals.
* Nick Do indicated that in fact the api in disease.sh would be much easier to customise within a tailor made front end.
* Nick Do continued to specify minimum requirements for the project involving a minimum 3 visualizations with at least one interactive tool each.
* Nick Do advised us to sign up for Miro, generate 6 proposals for at least 3 visualizations drawn from disease.sh api.
* Nick Do advised he would be available for a follow up meeting the next day at the same time.
* Nick Do requested we have a miro whiteboard prepared for the following meeting sceduled 10.30  30/06/2022.
* Sameera posed the question of potentially changing the project to one which was more focused on raw data processing.
* Nicholas O'Brien objected to changing the current project and suggested we manage the basic structure of the current project and potentially add on more specifically data processed components after initializing the functionality of a world map and time scale.
* Team agreed to move forward with the current project.

**Day subsequent actions**

* Nick C generated a miro team, invitations sent to team members.

**Meeting 5**

* Held discord meeting at 8pm with Nick Chitsamrerng, Sameera Begum and Nicholas O'Brien.
* Using discord and Miro the team organised 6 proposed visualisations to pitch with Nick Do the following morning.
* Nicholas O'Brien identified artefacts in some New Zealand data which exhibited discrepancy between daily vaccinations totals and overall total vaccinations updated.
* These discrepancy were notable for a correlation to another data sets.
* Team resolved to inquire Nick Do concerning "dailyPerHundred & dailyPerMillion" in vaccinations per country.

**Meeting 6**

**Presenting 6 Proposals**

* Held microsoft teams meeting at 10.30am with Nick Do, Nick Chitsamrerng, Sameera Begum and Nicholas O'Brien.
* Using teams Miro Whiteboard six proposals for visualizations were offered up to Nick Do.
* Nick Do classed in turn all six proposals as either easy, medium or hard.
* Team elected three seperate visualizations with an example of easy, medium and hard difficulty levels.
* It was suggested that we may gain time to incorporate all six proposals into the deployment.

**Identifying a need to apply data science**

* Nicholas O'Brien raised a discrepancy in the NZ data for vaccinations administered. Nick Do commented on this.
* The team agreed it to be a worthy exercise in data science that we take note of this discrepancy and it's management in contents presented to the user interface.

**Forming 3 required workstreams**

* Nick Do directed the team to split into 3 workstreams.

* The second workstream was to research cloud solutions for a react project.
* Sameera Begum elected this workstream.
* The third workstream was to create a react app, remove unnecessary files and upload it to Github.
* Nicholas O'Brien elected this workstream.
* Nick Do advised the first two tasks may take 2-3 days to complete.
* Nick Do advised that the third task should be complete for the following day in order to begin additional components of the third workstream the following day.
