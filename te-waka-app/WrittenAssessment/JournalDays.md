# Journal Days- Front End UI

# Week 4

**Week 4 Sunday 17/07/22**

* Spent some solid hours code following a js mastery video which was quite up to date building a dashboard with navbar landing page, multiple charts and components.
* Got part way through learning various es7 shortcuts and folder and file structure for a multipage dashboard.

**Week 4 Monday 18/07/22**

* Continued this effort marveling at syncfusion components and tailwind.css capabilities.
* Ended up about 2/3 way through with all components compiling well.

**Week 4 Tuesday 19/07/22**

* Completed tutorial from jsmastery with everything working well.

**Week 4 Wednesday 20/07/22**

* Began the process of turning what I had learned into a dashboard for our live data.
* Saw the complexity of transforming the dummy data links in the tutorial into the various links necessary for our live data charts.

**Week 4 Thursday 21/07/22**

* Started having second thoughts about using syncfusion packages compared to our charts.js/ react-chartjs-2 packages and bootstrap packages.
* Managed to achieve a compiling react project with navbar and sidebar titles showing in a correct layout.

**Week 4 Friday 22/07/22**

* Could not achieve a compiling routes layout in the sidebar showing the titles of our various charts.
* Decided to simply show progress update for the presentation the following day.

**Week 4 Saturday 23/07/22**

* Presented to the cohort with all team members.
* Presentation went well.

# Week 5

**Week 5 Monday 25/07/22**

* Considered using a simple index.html solution for display of our charts, followed a few shorter tutorials.
* Seemed apparent that syncfusion and our pre made chart files might be complicated to resolve.

**Week 5 Tuesday 26/07/22**

* Worked on the idea that I should reduce complexity of the tutorial example and produce simply the routes to pages rather than all the app functions eg color-picker of the js mastery tutorial.
* Started approaching a routes system that only compiled our chart files.

**Week 5 Wednesday 27/07/22**

* Became concerned that I would not achieve a solution when combining syncfusion and chart.js files and began investigating svelte tutorials.
* Was impressed with svelte and caught between continuing with react or re doing everything via svelte.

**Week 5 Thursday 28/07/22**

* Began to code follow some short svelte tutorials.
* Disheartened to see tutorials using dummy data and single api components.

**Week 5 Friday 29/07/22**

* Resolved to contact instructors to get advice on my compatibility and dummy data vs live api confusions.
* Continued watching svelte tutorials and react tutorials hoping that something would click.

**Week 5 Sunday 31/07/22**

* Received message that Instructor could join a call the following day.
* Began consolidating questions and issues for instructor.

# Week 6 Monday 1/08/22

* Resolved to reschedule instructor call until I had tried a few things in svelte or React.
* Wrote Journal Days and parts of Report md files and uploaded them to student repo.

# Week 6 Tuesday 2/08/22

* Removed syncfusion components and worked with a new tutorial.
* Using react, react-routerDOM, chart.js, react-chartjs-2 and sass managed to get some charts displaying on route pages without styling.

# Week 6 Wednesday 3/08/22

* Successfully compiled all routes to seperate pages.
* Next Step implement navbar and sidebar.

# Week 6 Thursday 4/08/22

* Implemented Sidebar and Navbar icons and styling.
* Next Step linking home icons to pages.
